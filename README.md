**Hi, Universe**

This is my first tailwind project. With in 40 hours in sum, I managed to create an HTML-TailwindCSS template.
At first it was challenging to use tailwind classes. Beside knowing less class, a huge number of classes on our element was kind frustrating.
Overtime I got used to it. Through out the journey, I messed a lot but I also learnt a lot of new things.

- With tailwind, I was able to add custom primary theme color. With this, I can easily change the main color of the website.
- You can see live demo [Here](https://sammy-techzard.github.io/endaTech/build)

**Technologies used**
---
As I said I used Tailwind. To do so, I used node.js and npm as package manage.
This improved my efficiency as I could easily run tailwind command to continously compile the file.
- to get started you need to install oll dependencies.
`run npm install`
- Next, you activate auto Tailwind compiler
`run tailwind` this will run the script `npx tailwindcss -i .build/input.css -o .build/style.css --watch` as it is in package.json file.
